				<h1 class="pacifico">About WhichBus</h1>

				<p>WhichBus is a simple, <em>beautiful</em> way to navigate public transit.</p>
				<p>What makes WhichBus special is that it combines both trip planning <em>and</em> real-time bus information in just a few easy steps, all within one app.</p>
				<p>WhichBus was created at the January 2012 <%= link_to "Startup Weekend", "http://www.startupweekend.org" %> in Seattle where it received the award for “Best Design.” We continued to develop the app at the April 2012 Startup Weekend focused on Seattle Government data where WhichBus received the award for “Best Overall Business.” Since then, we’ve been hard at work building out the site and testing the user experience.</p>
